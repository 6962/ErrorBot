I bit off a lot more than I could chew with this, and also really underestimated the amount of time I would be able to
sink into it.

The bot does "work" in a literal sense, but features, it does lack. When I tried to look into implementing the features that I set out when I had this idea, I realized too late that the scope didn't fit the time scale. This is still something I want to do, and probably will work on over the summer as while it does interest me, it was a poor decision to pursue for a project of this scale.

In essence I read a lot of docs, and realized left understanding about 30% of it.

To run the bot you'll need a Discord account if you don't have one.

Once you're there, make a server, and then open this link in another tab
> https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=572044604333883403

This will prompt you to invite the bot to your server of choice.

The bot will appear as "offline" (as I am aware of, but did not look further into solutions to "cache" the bot in an active state). You can set it up locally using the code in this repo, but you'll probably find it easier to just run it in my workspace, since you
won't have to get your own key that way. Just go to the terminal and run:

```
cd personal/errorbot
```
then:
```
node bot.js
```
(if anything breaks for some reason let me know)

The bot should now appear as "online"

The only command is a basic ping command, `$ping`

The prefix can be modified in `keys.json`

Sorry about this,

Diego
