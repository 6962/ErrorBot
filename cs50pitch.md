# Independent Project Pitch
#### Diego Eann

## Synopsis
Create a discord chatbot with basic functions designed for an FTC team.

All planned functionality can be found in the README of this repo, but I doubt I can implement that by the time the 24th comes, so for the project I would implement some of the more basic/realistic features of the bot, which I will list below.

I have done a little bit of work on this before the project start, but only what is already commited to this repo as of 5/8/19.

### GitHub feeds
* activity feeds for "watched" repos/orgs/users

### practice/team automation
* assign practice dates (+recurring)
* assign aliases to people (ie being able to use "Diego" in a command instead of mentioning `ire#3444`)

### pr
* be able to get feeds from selected twitter/instagram accounts
* send tweets from discord (idk how/if this works with instagram)

### TOA
* Ability to return a team report using data from [The Orange Alliance API](https://theorangealliance.org/)

## stretch:
These are basically "if I have time" parts of the project, that are more goals for a v1 release from the README

### practice/team automation
* tasks/deadlines

### pr
* oAuth for sending of posts through discord (twitter)

Thank you for your time!
